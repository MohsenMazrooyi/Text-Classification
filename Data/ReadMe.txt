Data 1:
arXiv Paper Abstracts - Context
Paper submission systems (CMT, OpenReview, etc.) require the users to upload paper titles and paper abstracts and then specify the subject areas their papers best belong to. Won't it be nice if such submission systems provided viable subject area suggestions as to where the corresponding papers could be best associated with?

This dataset would allow developers to build baseline models that might benefit this use case. Data analysts might also enjoy analyzing the intricacies
of different papers and how well their abstracts correlate to their noted categories. Additionally, we hope that the dataset will serve as a decent benchmark for building useful text classification systems.
